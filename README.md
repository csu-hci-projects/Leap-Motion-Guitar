# Leap Motion Guitar

## DeAnn Jones

### About
This is a project created for CS464: Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction Spring semester 2022 at Colorado State University. It features a virtual guitar made in the Unity game engine and can be played using a Leap Motion controller from Ultraleap.

## Use
First of all, a Leap Motion Controller from Ultraleap and Leap Motion service software is required to use the application prototype.  Leap Motion Service 4.1.0 (Orion) was used to build the prototype.  Any previous or greater versions of the service must be used at your own risk.

To play the Leap Motion Guitar Prototype, make a chord gesture on your left hand and strum the guitar with your right.

Chord guestures are as follows:

* One finger: C major chord
* Two fingers: D minor chord
* Three fingers: E minor chord
* Four fingers: F major chord
* Five fingers: G major chord
* No fingers: Standard tuning open chord sound/not a real chord
