        <h1>Abstract</h1>
        <p>Since the 1950s, artists and composers have been experimenting
          with computing technology as a medium to create digital art and
          music. In recent years, technological advances in motion detection
          sensor hardware and software have reached new heights allowing
          for immersive interaction with virtual environments. This research
          paper will discuss the use of Ultraleap, Inc.'s hand tracking technology
          known as Leap Motion controller in order to give users an
          alternative and technologically innovative platform to create music.
          This paper covers previous research regarding digital music and
          virtual instruments, describes the development of a prototype virtual
          guitar, a project research experiment, and also discusses future feature 
          enhancements and functional improvements of the Leap Motion Guitar prototype.</p>
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>With the invention of the digital transistor and integrated circuits in
          the 20th century, traditional musical instruments evolved into novel,
          unprecedented formats capable of creating iconic sounds such as the
          digital synthesizer and the electronic guitar. Also in the late 20th
          century, there was much growth in the study of human motion in
          biometrics including the work of Dr. Tom Calvert, 
          a leading technology professor in the study of computer science and kinesiology
          at that time. Dr Calvert created what was known as potentiometers
          that were computer sensors capable of tracking flexes and extensions of the human knee.
          Soon after this, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology developed an optical motion capture system
          that rendered an actorâ€™s movements in two dimensions. In recent
          years, motion detection hardware sensors and software have become
          widely used in a large range of industries, especially the computer
          gaming industry where such devices are used to interact with objects
          within virtual environments.</p>
        <p>This project builds upon multiple decades of this previous work
          and primarily focuses on the development of a virtual guitar
          system. The prototype uses the Unity game engine in order to
          provide interactive visual feedback and also utilizes an optical hand
          tracking hardware sensor called Ultraleap Leap Motion controller
          as the means of acquiring hand motion input. To create music, a
          musician just holds her hands above the Leap Motion controller
          which is placed directly in front of her computer keyboard. Her hand
          movements are visually reflected on the computer screen where
          she can provide chord numbers on the fingers of one hand while
          strumming the virtual guitar with her other hand. This research has
          a wide variety of practical uses such as in the education of music
          and music theory and may possibly one day replace the need for
          physical musical instruments in lieu of these new virtual forms.</p>

        <h1>Methodology</h1>
        <p>The Leap Motion Guitar project demonstrates and explores gesture
          and motion-based digital music applications and their potential capabilities. The prototype also suggests a possible user interface design
          to create guitar music through hand motions and gestures. Because
          the controller is capable of sensing hand and finger motions as input
          analogous to a mouse, it requires no physical contact or touching.
          In addition to the Unity Game Engine itself, the only other software
          that was required was the Leap Motion Unity Plugin. The initial
          functionality of the prototype involves using basic finger gestures
          representing chord progression numbers on one hand while making
          strumming gestures on the other. To achieve this, the guitar model is capable of detecting strumming patterns when the Leap Motion hand models intersect a three dimensional capsule collider located on the model itself where the
          virtual strings are located. This trigger then initiates specific guitar
          chord audio which is determined by the chord number gestured by
          the left hand. The Leap Motion controller API provides C Sharp
          scripts capable of providing the left hand motion states of which
          fingers are extended and which are not.</p>
          <img src="images/Capsule_Collider.JPG"/>
          <p>The prototype focuses only on the musical key of C
            major. Because the majority of popular songs only utilize the first five
            chords in a key, this project only focuses on producing specific
            guitar chord audio from this subset of C major which are as follows:
            <ol>
              <li> C major(C)</li>
              <li> D minor(Dm)</li>
              <li> E minor(Em)</li>
              <li> F major(F)</li>
              <li> G major(G)</li>
            </ol></p>

        <h1>Results</h1>
        <p>Within the sample of 10 participants, 40% were female, 30% were
          male, 10% were non-binary, and the remaining 10% chose not to
          state their gender. The dominating age of the group was between 36
          and 45 years of age and comprised 30% of the participant sample.
          20% of the participants were between 18 and 25 years of age; 20%
          were between the ages of 26 and 35; 20% were under the age of
          18; 10% were 45 or older. 20% of the participants had no musical experience, 
          30% had some to moderate experience, while 40% were
          very musically inclined. Only 10% of the participants were profes-
          sional musicians. Based on these percentages, the average skill level
          amongst the participant pool was 4.8. This means that the overall
          skill level was slightly less than moderate, with a standard deviation
          3.341.</p>
          <p>A vast amount of the
          participants could play the five chords created for this experiment;
          however, playing a song proved to be slightly more difficult. Some
          could see this type of technology being prevalent in the future, and a
          vast majority would enjoy seeing things like the Leap Motion Guitar
          prototype in the future.</p>

        <h1>Discussion</h1>
        <p>The Leap Motion Guitar prototype allows musicians visual exposure and 
          the ability to interact with a virtual guitar. The user is able
          to produce music without requiring the knowledge of how to truly
          play the instrument and in doing so, learns actual musical theory
          involving chord progression numbers. The user is also able to learn
          chord finger positions on a standard guitar tuning. Future additions
          to the prototype could include more advanced hand gestures more
          closely related to playing traditional guitar chords as well as possible
          gestures for advanced chords.</p>
          <p>Since the experiment participants expressed difficulty with simple
          hand gestures, these features may be beyond the capabilities and
          data resolution output of the Leap Motion Controller device.
          I hope that the findings of this experiment will further other works that
          help those with disabilities or low socioeconomic status benefit from
          what music has to offer. Furthermore, I hope that the limitations
          of this experiment will influence more advocacy for this type of
          technology.
